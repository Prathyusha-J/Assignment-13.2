1. HFile :
A)
file of sorted key/value pairs. 
Both keys and values are byte arrays.
When the MemStore accumulates enough data, the entire sorted KeyValue set is written 

2 HRegion Server:
A)
It checks in with the HMaster. 
There are many HRegionServers in a single HBase deployment.
Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
Regions are assigned to the Region Servers.


3 HBase Meta Table
The .META. table keeps a list of all regions in the system. The .META. table structure is as follows:
Key:Region key of the format ([table],[region start key],[region id])
Values:info:regioninfo (serialized HRegionInfo instance for this region)


4 Zookeeper
HBase uses ZooKeeper as a distributed coordination service to maintain server state in the cluster.
Zookeeper maintains which servers are alive and available, and provides server failure notification.

5 How read and write operation is performed in HBase.
*Read Operation:
A read request is sent to zookeeper from Hbase by the client.
The zookeeper,gives the address for the META table.
The process gets the region address of table from the META Table.
From the specific HRegion, the process enters the BlockCache where data is present from previous read. 
If the table is found, the process returns to client with the data as result.
If the table is not found, the process starts to search MemStore. 

*Write Operation:
When the client issues a Put request, the first step is to write the data to the write-ahead log, the WAL:
Edits are appended to the end of the WAL file that is stored on disk.
The WAL is used to recover not-yet-persisted data in case a server crashes.
